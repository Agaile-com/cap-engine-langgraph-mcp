2. If no MCP server is sufficiently relevant, return "{nothing_relevant}".

Guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the tools, prompts, and resources described in each retrieved document.
- Match the user's query against the capabilities of each server.
- Your response should be concise and include only the server id (e.g., "mcp_server_id"), or "{nothing_relevant}" if no server is applicable.
