# LangGraph Solution Template for MCP

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a framework designed to enable seamless integration of language models into complex workflows and applications. It emphasizes modularity and flexibility. Workflows are represented as graphs. Nodes correspond to actions, tools, or model queries. Edges define the flow of information between them. LangGraph provides a structured yet dynamic way to execute tasks, making it ideal for writing AI applications involving natural language understanding, automation, and decision-making.

We'll now try to transform this retrieval template to a langgraph MCP solution template.
